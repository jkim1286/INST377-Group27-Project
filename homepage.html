        <h2>Mission Impact and Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>For our project, we are addressing carbon emission reduction. One of the most important issues that we need to address is the climate crisis. Emission reduction refers to minimizing greenhouse gasses generated by individuals, organizations, or countries. Itâ€™s important to solve this issue by providing techniques to reduce your carbon footprint. In terms of the people who are about this problem, major stakeholders include large corporations, activist groups, researchers, and civilians. Overall, this issue involves everyone, but the amount of power and impact each stakeholder group has can vary depending on how they plan to use our project. To solve this problem, we are developing a website that provides users ways to reduce their carbon footprint. It will also provide goals for you to set to reduce your carbon. The website will provide helpful tips from research backed resources on ways to become more environmentally conscious.
            We will be using Climatiq, a calculation of environmental footprint created by a broad range of emission-generated activities. We are also considering using Carbon Interface, API to calculate carbon (CO2) emissions estimates for common CO2 emitting activities. These two APIs will be helpful since they contain information directly related to carbon emissions. We plan to utilize these two APIs when providing a plan for the user for when they need examples on what to reduce.
